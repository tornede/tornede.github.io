Tanja Tornede is a Researcher at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence at Leibniz University Hannover (LUH). She is doing her Ph.D. at Paderborn University supervised by Eyke HÃ¼llermeier within the field of AutoML for Predictive Maintenance, especially the estimation of Remaining Useful Lifetime of machines. Nowadays, she more and more thought about the environmental impacts of AutoML in general, which is why she started her research into that direction and coined the term Green AutoML. Since 2021 she is on a mission to create awareness for the environmental impact of (AutoML) research, motivating researchers to rethink their own habits and workflows.
