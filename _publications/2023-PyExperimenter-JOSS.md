abstract: "PyExperimenter is a tool to facilitate the setup, documentation, execution, and subsequent evaluation of results from an empirical study of algorithms and in particular is designed to reduce the involved manual effort significantly. It is intended to be used by researchers in the field of artificial intelligence, but is not limited to those."
